v1.3.3 (14/07/2023)
======

Bug fixes:
 - Fixed crash when saving extra outputs and using an absolute path in CATALOG


v1.3.2 (16/07/2022)
======

Bug fixes:
 - Fixed compilation with GCC 11.x


v1.3.1 (04/06/2021)
======

Features:
 - Added line number information to error messages from the LIR input catalog

Bug fixes:
 - Added missing "log_bc_age_max" to the hash for cached grids (will invalidate existing grids)
 - Fixed grid2fits reading data in wrong order where there is more than one galaxy
 - Fixed compilation with XCode 12
 - Fixed compiler setup not properly propagated to dependencies (CFITSIO etc.)


v1.3.0 (12/06/2019)
======

Features:
 - Added a differential attenuation model a la Charlot & Fall.


v1.2.1 (20/03/2019)
======

Bug fixes:
 - Fixed best-fit SED wrong normalization when BEST_FROM_SIM=1 (thanks Themiya Nanayakkara)
 - Fixed Milky Way attenuation curve (thanks anhackastro)


v1.2 (13/01/2019)
====

Features:
 - Added the APPLY_VDISP opion, to convolve SEDs with a fixed velocity dispersion.
 - Added the REST_MAG option to produce rest-frame magnitudes.
 - Added the CUSTOM_SFH_LOOKBACK option to have time running backwards in the custom SFH expression
 - Added the CONTINUUM_INDICES option to produce absorption line EWs, Dn4000, etc.
 - Added fast++-grid2fits tool to convert .grid files into .fits files.
 - Added fast++-sfh2sed tool to produce SED for a given SFH.
 - Added 'nmodel' as a possible output column, showing the number of models fit to each galaxy.
 - Added the NO_IGM option to disable IGM absorption.
 - Added the SFH_QUANTITIES option to output non-parametric quantities of the SFH.
 - When not using EAzY photometric redshifts, confidence intervals can now be freely chosen.
 - Added option to fit log(LIR) instead of LIR, better for galaxies with uncertain Tdust.
 - Added the INTERVAL_FROM_CHI2 option to compute conf intervals from chi2 grid directly.

Bug fixes:
 - Made sure that attenuation law never goes negative.
 - Added explicit check for galaxies with no valid data.
 - Added the DEBUG option to help identify invalid models.
 - Added explicit check to catch incorrect wavelength units in filters.
 - Fixed crash for galaxies with spectra but no valid photometry (thanks to Hugh Dickinson).
 - Fixed issues with unexpected line endings in input files.
 - Fixed bug where it was not possible to use the 'mw' dust law (thanks brojonat).
 - Fixed incorrect MC outputs for unsorted grids (e.g., metallicity, thanks Themiya Nanayakkara).
 - Fixed missing column names on the .input_res.fit files (thanks Themiya Nanayakkara).
 - Fixed MC conf intervals for gridded values close to grid edges (thanks Francesco Valentino).

Performances:
 - Added the 'generators' parallel execution scheme, which should be faster in all cases.
 - Improved performances of dust attenuation.
 - Faster implementation of the fit progress bar.
 - Improved speed of MAKE_SEDS by about a factor 5, and also enabled multithreading for this stage.
 - Simplified IGM absorption formula.


v1.1 (08/11/2017)
====

Bug fixes:
 - BEST_FROM_SIM=1 now produces valid chi2 and best-fit SEDs.
 - The FILTER.RES file is now read exactly as in FAST and EAzY, to avoid some incompatibilities.

Other changes:
 - When MAKE_SED=1, the fitting stage is now disabled and the program only creates the SEDs.


v1.0 (13/09/2017)
====

Features:
 - This is the first release that contains all the features of the original FAST.
 - Additional features:
   - Custom star formation histories
   - Priors on L_IR
   - More outputs: average SFR, ionizing luminosity, dust luminosity, formed stellar mass, ...
   - Create SEDs from list of models and stellar masses
   - Multithreading
